# OS_Project_Algorithms

This is the Operating System Project we made in a team.

It contains the working of 4 algorithms related to Operating System Syllabus.
The 4 algorithms include :
  - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
  - Dining Philosopher's Problem (with Semaphores)
  - Look / C-Look Disk Scheduling Algorithm
  - FIFO (First In First Out) Page Replacement Algorithms

In this website you will get to experience:
  - What are the algorithms all about
  - How the alogrithms produce results for different outputs
